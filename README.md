# TaskList

Description- 
This is a simple app that allows the user to input tasks that will be displayed. Once displayed the user will have the option to 
choose and then delete any tasks they have completed.

Technologies Used- 
This app was created in Android Studio with Koltin and XML. This app is my introduction to Android applications and served as a guide through
basic android design, basic Koltin, as well as a place to play around with themes and styles between day mode and night mode. 

How To Run- 
Make sure you have downdload a virtual device with Google Play compatability in Android Studio's AVD Manager. Download the files provided in Task List 
provided. Once downloaded, open as a project and run the Task List app on your virtual device. 

How To Use- 
Press on the bottm left text field, then type a task you want to add to your Task List. Once entered, press the "ADD TASK" button. The task will apear
on the top of the screen. Do this as many times as you would like; if there are too many tasks to fill the screen, you can scroll down to see you other tasks.
Once your list is created, you can press on the empty checkbox next to the entered task which will put a line through the task, indicating that you have 
finished that task. Once you have cross off any tasks that you hvae finished, you can then press the "DELTETE TASK" button, which will then delete any
task that is crossed off. 

Future Implimentations-
To improve the quality of the app, a feature that saves the tasks on your local device should be added. For the time being, once the activity is
refreshed, the tasks are deleted. Also, the font color could change for better readability of the tasks in the app. For the time being, I could not change
the font color to suit light mode and dark mode, so one font color that was at least readable in both modes was chosen.
